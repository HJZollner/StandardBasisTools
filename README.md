# StandardBasisTools
 Tools to generate standardized basis spectra and LCM fitting results representations
 
We have released initial guidelines for a standardized data format to store basis spectra and LCM results. This standard will: 
- provide a common format for data sharing
- reduce workload to support file formats specific to a single density matrix simulation software
- increase transparency and reproducibility by adding relevant metadata
- increase between-software compatibility; and e) maximize the integration of MRS into existing software- and data-sharing efforts.

The development is spearheaded by the Code and Data Sharing Committee of the ISMRM MRS study group, encouraging community feedback and contributions via the community forum (forum.mrshub.org).

## Preliminary Example data
This repository currently contains an example analysis of an [HERCULES MRS dataset]( 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.002
). The data is provided in NIfTI-MRS format ([MRSHub forum thread] (https://forum.mrshub.org/t/nifti-mrs-discussion-thread/443) or full [manuscript] ( https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29418) for reference) and anlyzed using [Osprey](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey).
